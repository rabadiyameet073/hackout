## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: #F0FFF0 (Honeydew), a very light tint of sea green, to offer a clean and calm user experience.
- Accent color: #B8860B (Goldenrod), a muted analogous color suggesting sunshine, adding emphasis to actionable items without overpowering the natural palette.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to give a clear and friendly appearance.
- Use clear and concise icons that represent incident types, map markers, and reporting actions, filled in to indicate activation, and outlined otherwise.
- Employ a mobile-first, single-column layout to ensure readability and usability on smaller screens, and intuitive use while out in nature.
- Subtle animations, such as smooth transitions between screens and loading states, to enhance user experience.
